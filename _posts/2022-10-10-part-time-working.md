I have worked part-time in a number of different roles and career stages.


## People will assume you're having a holiday




## Your're working within a 5 day week structure

When you work part time, you're most commonly still working within the normal 5 day a week structure.


## Thursdays aren't fridays

When I went part-time the obvious day to stop working seemed to be Friday.


## Bank holidays are bad and complicated

Bank holidays are a strange situation if you are a part-time worker. People think that if you would normally work the bank holiday then it's a holiday and you're lucky to get paid for it. And if you don't normally work it, then bad luck. But that's not how it often works.

To avoid this situation companies count up the bank holidays a full time worker would get (e.g. 11) and then award you a pro-rata version of that on top of your leave allowance. You then are responsible for taking those days as leave.
