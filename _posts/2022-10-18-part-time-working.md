I've worked part-time a few times in my career. At the moment that means working 4 days a week, Monday to Thursday, and doing childcare on Fridays. That's great, and I'm mega fortunate to have the flexibility to adjust my work/life balance in that way. But, there are some things about part time I've been dwelling on.

## Your're working in a 5 day week structure

The '4 day week' is currently undergoing many trials, and appears to be [showing benefits for individuals and businesses](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/17/four-day-week-british-new-bill-workers-businesses). The UK currently works long hours with low productivity, and it seems the two are linked.

I'm not really doing 'the 4 day week', that only works if everyone does it.

I'm not too confident of a  day week being adopted. Not through lack of evidence, it looks evidently to be the . It feels really difficult to get our society out of ingrained habits, despite evidence. Overwhlemingly risk averse business leaders will always struggle to understand how working less is more productive.

> Those who argued against moving from a six-day week to a five-day week 100 years ago said the economy would suffer â€“ and the very same arguments about workers not being able to adapt and businesses not being able to afford it are being made again now against a four-day week.

## Fewer hours make time really sensitive

Good time management is always important, but especially so when you're working reduced hours. Even at 4 days a week this is very noticeable - a day filled up with meetings can take out your week. 

There are simple ways of coping with this: things like booking focus time in your calendar, declining meetings, 



## You get paid less

Wtf?! is that even legal? Well yes it is. If you only do 4/5ths of the work you get paid 4/5ths of your wage.

As with the benefits of the 4 day week, I'd argue that working less I'm overall more productive and efficient. And ultimately my wage shouldn't be calculated a multiplying the number of days worked by a set amount, but by the value I bring in being employed by the organisation.

Still, an organisation can't have just one person decide to not work on one day of the week and get paid their normal wage - everyone would want to (good!)

The problem with getting paid less though is that in a cost of living . It could be that depending on how things go I need to either move to full time work, find a higher paid role, or a second job/freelance (or all 3).

With part time, I don't know of a fair mechanism for pay bt it doesn't feel like a linear . An example of someone working two days a week to do the accountancy for an organisation is obviously delivering more value than 2/5ths of the full time salary. But at the same time it's. Id argue for having a base pay, based on the role, and then banded hours where you can choose more or less in exchange for 



## Thursdays aren't fridays


When I went part-time the obvious day to stop working seemed to be Friday. Working a full week has a certain pattern - slow start on Monday, busier middle of the week, and a gradual slow down on Friday. 

It would be easy to assume the same 


## Bank holidays are bad and annoying

What happens if a day you would normally work falls on a bank holiday? You get the day off, right? Not quite, you get some of the day off (e.g 4/5ths).

That's OK - it's still time off. But you're not really allowed to work 1/5th of a day, so you need to take annual leave to cover the rest of the time. This means that for people working part time, by the end of the year their annual leave (already ) may be significantly cut down through covering bank holidays and shut down days. 


## People will assume you're having a holiday
