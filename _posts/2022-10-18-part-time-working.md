I've worked part-time a few times in my career. At the moment that means working 4 days a week, Monday to Thursday, and doing childcare on Fridays. That's great, and I'm mega fortunate to have the flexibility to adjust my work/life balance in that way. But, there are some things about part time I've been thinking about.

## Your're working in a 5-day week world

The '4 day week' is currently undergoing many trials, and appears to be [showing benefits for individuals and businesses](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/17/four-day-week-british-new-bill-workers-businesses). The UK currently works long hours with low productivity, and it seems the two are linked.

I'm not really doing 'the 4 day week', that only works if everyone is doing it.

I'm not too confident of a  day week being adopted. It feels really difficult to get our society out of set habits, despite evidence. Overwhlemingly risk averse business leaders will always struggle to understand the concept of working less to achieve more.

> Those who argued against moving from a six-day week to a five-day week 100 years ago said the economy would suffer â€“ and the very same arguments about workers not being able to adapt and businesses not being able to afford it are being made again now against a four-day week.

## Fewer hours make time really sensitive

Good time management is always important, but especially so when you're working reduced hours. Even at 4 days a week this is very noticeable - a couple of days with a few meetings can destroy your week. 

There are simple ways of coping with this: things like booking focus time in your calendar, declining meetings, and being more efficient with your time. But it's a battle.




## Thursdays aren't fridays


When I went part-time the obvious day to stop working seemed to be Friday. Working a full week has a certain pattern - gradual start on Monday, busier middle of the week, and a slow down on Friday. 

It would be easy to assume the same for a 4 day week. You gradually slow down on Thursday and then chill between 4 and 5pm when you're finishing up. But in reality your normal Thursday just becomes a busy Thursday.


## Bank holidays are bad and annoying

For people who work part time, what happens if a day you would normally work falls on a bank holiday? You get the day off, right? Not quite, you get some of the day off (e.g 4/5ths).

That's OK - it's still time off. But you're not really allowed to work 1/5th of a day, so you need to take annual leave to cover the rest of the time. This means that for people working part time, by the end of the year their annual leave (already ) may be significantly cut down through covering bank holidays and shut down days.
